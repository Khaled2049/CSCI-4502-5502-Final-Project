# CSCI-4502-5502-Final-Project
## What this is
For our final project in data mining we used python, numpy and pandas to build user-user and item-user based collaborative filtering systems to try and predict/reccomend classes a student should take in college. 
## Data references
We gathered our data from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10237496/#sec020)
For more information on where these datas were gathered from please look at the readme in our data folder referenced here:
[Dataset readme](https://github.com/Khaled2049/CSCI-4502-5502-Final-Project/tree/master/dataset)
## Results
Our models recorded incredibly high accuracy for the user-user filtering. Because we had a large database of students and most classes are required we were able to achive near 97% accuracy.
## How to replicate
Dependencies for Python:
- Pandas
- Numpy
Any notebook with python3 and these dependencies should be able to execute the code within the repo
